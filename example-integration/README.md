# Reagent with shadow-cljs

This is a minimal setup for using this mini example.
I'm working on this. Create a Clojure mini-OZ-lib.

## Getting started

Run `yarn` to download dependencies.

To have a local development server running do `yarn dev`; then visit
[localhost:8020](http://localhost:8020). You can configure the port in
`shadow-cljs.edn`. Whenever you make a change it will automatically reload the
code and render again.

To make a production build use `yarn release`.

To configure further please check out
[shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs).
